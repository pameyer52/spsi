# SPSI

## Description:

SPSI (simplest possible structure interpolator) is a tool for creating intermediate macromolecular structures from a pair of endpoint structures - otherwise known as morphs.  These can be useful for illustrating conformational changes in macromolecules, and are often displayed as movies.

There are other ways to do this (see the Alternatives section below), which may have more features.  SPSI is an attempt to handle things as simply as possible (in an effort to reduce potential installation and configuration issues).


## Installation:
SPSI requires [python](http://www.python.org)>= 2.5 (earlier versions with sqlite3 may function, but are untested).  Python 3 also works.  SPSI can be used stand-alone (from the command line), or from within PyMOL.  SPSI has been tested on linux and OS X, but should run on any system with a standard python installation.

### Stand-Alone Installation: 

Copy spsi.py to a directory in your $PATH.

### PyMOL-Integrated Installation:

**TODO**

## Usage:
**TODO** usage instructions go here


## Contributers:
Just me (Pete Meyer) so far.

## Alternatives:
RigiMOL (bundled with incentive PyMOL) and LSQMAN (from Uppsala Software Factory) are some other (probably more feature rich) options for creating morphs.
